# String Calculator

This kata implements a calculator that contains a function *add* for adding numbers.

This function must receive a string as input and produce a string as output.

* The function takes numbers separated by comma or new-line and returns their sum.
* An empty string will return '0'.
* The function must handle an unknown number of inputs.
* It is possible that a number is missing in the last position. In this case, the calculator should return an error message.
* Calling *add* with negative numbers must produce an error message.

Example of inputs: '', '1', '1.1,2.2', '1\n2,3', '1,3,', '2,-1'.
