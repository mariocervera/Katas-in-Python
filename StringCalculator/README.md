# String Calculator

Implement a function *add* for adding numbers. The function must receive a string as input and produce a string as output.

Expected behavior:

* The function takes numbers (integers or floats) separated by comma (or new-line) and returns their sum.
* An empty string will return '0'.
* The function must be able handle an unknown number of inputs.
* It is possible that a number is missing in the last position. In this case, the function should return an error message.
* Calling *add* with negative numbers must produce an error message.

Example of inputs:

''

'1'

'1.1,2.2'

'1\n2,3'

'1,3,'

'2,-1'
